# 1. Variables / Types
# my_age=31
# my_name="vishnu"
# my_wife="athira"
# print(f"hi, my name is { my_name} and I am {my_age}, my wifes's name is {my_wife}")

# Challenge 1 - Variables

# Python has a bunch of pre-made, built-in tools which you can use to perform tasks. 
# One is these tools is the input() function which allows us to retrieve a user input. 
# You can see these here, including the input() function: https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_functions.asp

# Read about the input() function, try out the example to see how it works, and then only proceed.

# For this challenge, use this input function to ask ‚ÄúWhat is your favorite color?‚Äù. 
# Save the response into a variable named my_input. 
# Then print ‚ÄúYour favorite color is my_input‚Äù. 
# So if I type red as my favorite color, it will print ‚ÄúYour favorite color is red‚Äù. 


# # WORK OUT YOUR SOLUTION HERE
# my_input=input("What is your favorite color?")
# print("Your favorite color is"+" "+my_input)



# 2. Conditional Logic
# my_number=int(input("enter the number: "))
# if my_number > 5:
#     print("Your number is greater than")
# elif my_number<5 :
#     print("Your number is less than 5")
# else:
#     print("Your number is equal to 5")


# my_number=int(input("enter the number: "))
# if my_number>0 and my_number<10:
#     print("Your nunber is single digit")
# else:
#     print("your number is not single digit")


# Challenge 2 - Conditionals - Rock, Paper, Scissors

# We'll use what we've so far to create the Rock, Paper, Scissors game. Here's how:

# First, you'll need to capture inputs for both Player 1 and Player 2. 

# Next, you'll use conditionals to check the two answers and see who wins. This seems pretty
# complicated on the surface but don't overthink it. Here's some help: 
# If Player 1 plays Paper, then there are only two conditionals to check against (Rock, Scissors).
# This means for each element, there should be two checks, totalling 6 checks overall. Each check 
# should print "Player x wins" with the correct player based on the condition. 

# Finally, there should be a check for the same element being played, i.e. if both players play rock
# then an error message should be printed like "Error, you aren't allowed to play the same thing".

# WORK OUT YOUR SOLUTION HERE
# print("Welcome to Rockü™®, PaperüóûÔ∏è  Scissors‚úÇÔ∏è game")
# player_1=input("Hi, player1Ô∏è‚É£. Enter you input: ").lower()
# player_2=input("Hi, player2Ô∏è‚É£. Enter you input: ").lower()
# if player_1==player_2:
#     print("Error, you aren't allowed to play the same thing")
# elif player_1 =="rock" and player_2=="paper":
#     print("Player 2 wins")
# elif player_1 =="rock" and player_2=="scissors":
#     print("Player 1 wins")
# elif player_1 =="paper" and player_2=="rock":
#     print("Player 1 wins")
# elif player_1 =="paper" and player_2=="scissors":
#     print("Player 2 wins")
# elif player_1 =="scissors" and player_2=="rock":
#     print("player 2 wins")
# elif player_1 =="scissors" and player_2=="Paper":
#     print("player 1 wins")
# else:
#     print("Something went wrong, Please try again")

# Challenge 4 - Loops

# items = ["steak", "apple", "bread", "butter", "pineapple"]


# 1. Write a 'for loop' that loops through the above list and prints "item is a fruit" or "item is not a fruit" depending on whether it is or not. 
#    Note that it should not say item but the name of the fruit. So 'steak is not a fruit', 'apple is a fruit', etc. 

# WORK OUT YOUR SOLUTION HERE

# items = ["steak", "apple", "bread", "butter", "pineapple"]
# for item in items:
#     if item=="apple" or item=="pineapple":
#         print( item +" is fruit")
#     else:
#        print(item+ " is not fruit")
        
# 2. Write a while loop starting with a counter = 1 that multiplies two to your counter, prints the counter, but breaks the loop after the counter reaches 1000. 


# WORK OUT YOUR SOLUTION HERE

# counter=1
# while counter < 1000:
#  counter *=2
#  print(counter)

# FINAL PROJECT - Password Checker

# 1. Get password input
# 2. Check if password has lowercase, uppercase, a number, and a special character. 
# 3. If the password doesn't meet all four conditions, then reject with the conditions they still need to meet.
# 4. Only accept if all four conditions are met.
# 5. Add a condition to check that password length is greater than 9 digits. If 9 or less, it fails.

# Hints/Suggestions:
# - Break password into list of letters and loop through to check type (upper, lower, etc.). Check out
#   the Python string package for help with upper, lower, and digits. https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html. Import this package by
#   putting 'import string' at the top of your file. This will import the library and give you access to its methods.
# - Consider creating a function or two to clean up any repetitiveness. 
# - Remember that there are many ways to complete this task. Many programmers will provide many different solutions. Some will
#   be more "efficient" or more "clean" than others. Who cares at this point. Find what solutions works for you AND successfully
#   checks passwords and call it a win!
